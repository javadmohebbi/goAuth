# goAuth
Simple &amp; Easy go package for **authorization**.

Implementing Authentication & Authorization in a right way, some time took time from developers. I have developed a simple & easy-understandig `go module` for **Authorization**.


# Dependencies
There is no specific dependencies but I use  **gorm** (The great ORM library for Golang) as ORM library for **CRUD** in test DB. You can read it's docs [here]([here](https://gorm.io/index.html)).



# Usage
To use this `go module` you must run the further command.

```
go get github.com/javadmohebbi/goAuth
```


### - Basic Example
